            "Enter Review: Writing this review after 7 months of usage I have bought nearly 7 to 8 models in redmi before few budget and few note series. This is the worst phone i used in terms of performance and touch  Note: I bought it for my parents - > No apps installed other than watsapp(very minimal usage only they will see receiving messages), only it has default apps which cant be uninstalled, only usage in this mobile is calls, and occasionally watching youtube  Pros: Good battery life. Cons: * Touch is not responds most of the times after 2-3 months of usage, even you can access touch in some important situations while attending incoming call, while unlocking, you have to lock screen using power button 3-4 times and try again to make touch respond. - * Very lag sometimes - it is happening after 2-3 month usage. * Sometime network reception is bad\n"
